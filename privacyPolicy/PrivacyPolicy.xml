  <title>OctoGram as an open source project</title>
  <body>OctoGram is an open source project and is consistent with Telegram's API terms of use. OctoGram follows the GPL-2.0 license, also chosen by the official Telegram project, which can be visited <a href='https://github.com/OctoGramApp/OctoGram/blob/revamp/LICENSE' target='_blank'>here</a>. 

  The entire client is <a href='https://github.com/OctoGramApp/OctoGram' target='_blank'>open source</a> and complies with the <a href='https://core.telegram.org/reproducible-builds' target='_blank'>Reproducible Builds</a> offered by Telegram.

  The site, intended as a custom project not dependent on Telegram, is also <a href='https://github.com/OctoGramApp/Website' target='_blank'>open source</a> and is based on the GPL-2.0 license that can be visited <a href='https://github.com/OctoGramApp/website/blob/main/LICENSE'>here</a>.

  Use of personal data and permissions:

  OctoGram has basic services, which are necessary for proper functioning. The app may be unstable if this is not the case.

  The app is based on:
  - <a href='https://support.google.com/android/answer/10546414' target='_blank'>Google Play Services</a> and all references to it
  - <a href='https://firebase.google.com/' target='_blank'>Google Firebase Notifications</a> used to send notifications

  Used permissions vary depending on the user's use of the application. Listed below are all the permissions with the main uses.

  - Location: is used when sending a location (or real-time location, referred to as "live location") or when using the "people nearby" feature
  - Photos and videos: used when expanding the media picker to send media in a chat, when uploading a story, when editing your own or a group profile photo
  - Files and documents: is used when expanding the media picker to send a file in a chat
  - Audio: is used when recording a voice message in a chat, or when recording a video in any way (via VIDEO or VIDEOMESSAGE or STORY)
  - Contacts: is used when choosing to synchronise contacts (option offered when first opening and can be deactivated from the Privacy and Security settings)</body>

  <title>Log data (and crash log)</title>
  <body>OctoGram will never send data automatically to the server. Sending the data is only in your hands.

  The basic logs are consistent with those in the official Telegram application. OctoGram has implemented its own logging method only for recording crashes. Again, the app offers the user the possibility of sending crashes but does not do so automatically.

  Crash logs are sent as files in our official group. They contain data such as:
  - version of OctoGram and the version on which OctoGram is based
  - the device name and android version
  - the performance class with which Telegram detects the device
  - the language applied to the device from the system settings
  - the presence or absence of Google Play Services
  - the entire OctoGram settings configuration
  - the error that caused the crash

  OctoGram will never share your phone number, IP or other similar data via the crash log.</body>

  If you are an EU or United Kingdom citizen, you must be at least 16 years old to register. Externally, OctoGram is not intended for use by children under the age of 14.
